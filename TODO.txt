-- school records page?

-- add JS popup loading thing for import data
	
-- view: athletes#new

-- DRY up:
	-- athletes#index
	-- event_list.each in MarksController
	-- Athlete#has_data? so that it doesn't gather all the objects, just gets a count
		-- probably do a custom sql query?
	-- athletes#update and marks#create
		-- almost exactly the same except for the destroy_all in athletes#update

-- make athlete pages have URLs that aren't /athletes/id
	-- ex) /athletes/matt+bernstein or something like that
	
-- athletes to add:
	-- seth wimberly (didn't work)
	-- solomon turner
	-- maddy schultz
	-- collin cowdery (lol)
	-- josh gallagher
	
-- switch this to tfrrs.org!!!! (more reliable, directathletics repeats data)

-- athletes to delete duplicate indoor/outdoor marks:
	-- molly martorella (mile)
	-- amanda gracia
	-- DJ (mile)
	-- Krichels (mile)
	-- quinn (mile)

-- look into direct athletics API: http://images.tfrrs.org/TFRRS_API_18.pdf

Notes:
-- dump db: pg_dump athlete_lookup_development > backup_db (or whatever name you want)
