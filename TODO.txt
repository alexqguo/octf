-- school records page?

-- add JS popup loading thing for import data
	
-- view: athletes#new

-- helper method for rendering mark (formatting string, adding "m" or "s" etc.)

-- DRY up:
	-- athletes#index
	-- event_list.each in MarksController
	-- Athlete#has_data? so that it doesn't gather all the objects, just gets a count
		-- probably do a custom sql query?
	-- athletes#update and marks#create
		-- almost exactly the same except for the destroy_all in athletes#update

-- make athlete pages have URLs that aren't /athletes/id
	-- ex) /athletes/matt+bernstein or something like that
	
-- athletes to add:
	-- seth wimberly
	-- solomon turner
	-- maddy schultz
	-- collin cowdery (lol)
	-- josh gallagher

-- dump db just in case
