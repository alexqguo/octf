-- OCTF (change the title to something more interesting)

-- Home page
	-- recent headlines?
		-- rss feeds on the website are separated in to m/f with a lot being similar so this is a problem
		-- goyeo.com doesn't work with open-uri at all so this won't work
		-- wtrack: goyeo.com/rss.aspx?rss=ZAcp4bsO
		-- mtrack: goyeo.com/rss.aspx?rss=CvcY9DTM

-- all athletes
	-- add jQuery popup loading thing for import data

-- mobile
	-- make the condition better, not just check for screen width

-- separate file for highcharts scripts

-- move the school records constants into a completely separate file
	-- eventually will probably have to make a model for it, so that there can be an edit page for admin

-- add an "Update Everything" button for admin that will run through all athletes and call fetch_from_tfrrs?

-- implement redis for graph_data

-- BUGS
	-- (nothing major right now)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- DRY up:
	-- athletes#update and marks#create
		-- almost exactly the same except for the destroy_all in athletes#update

-- look into tfrrs API: http://images.tfrrs.org/TFRRS_API_18.pdf

Notes:
-- dump db: pg_dump athlete_lookup_development > backup_db (or whatever name you want)
-- heroku pg:psql DATABASE_URL < backup.sql
