-- DRY up:
	-- athletes#index
	-- app.html.erb -> a lot of (if current_user) statements
	-- event_list.each in MarksController
	-- Athlete#has_data? so that it doesn't gather all the objects, just gets a count
		-- probably do a custom sql query?
	-- athletes#update and marks#create
		-- almost exactly the same except for the destroy_all in athletes#update

-- look into tfrrs API: http://images.tfrrs.org/TFRRS_API_18.pdf


Notes:
-- dump db: pg_dump athlete_lookup_development > backup_db (or whatever name you want)
