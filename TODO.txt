-- implement algorithm into athlete helper or maybe controller since the view doesn't need to be gathering the data for the athlete, it only needs to happen once and that can/should take place in controller

-- on athlete's show page:
	-- if athlete has no marks, have a button to import data (maybe routes to marks#new)
	-- else, display that data
	
-- refactor Athlete#has_data? so that it doesn't gather all the objects, just gets a count
	-- probably do a custom sql query?
	
-- display data on athletes#show
